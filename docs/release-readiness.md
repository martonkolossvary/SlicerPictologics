# Release readiness

Review date: 2026-09-19. Extension/result contract remains **0.1.0**.

## Stabilized baseline

- Pictologics **0.5.1**, installed from the published PyPI wheel into immutable,
  extension-owned environments. Slicer's shared packages are not replaced.
- Reinstalled **Slicer 5.12.4**, Python 3.12, Intel/Rosetta on macOS:
  private installation, API/full-JIT probes, and fresh-process reuse without a
  reinstall passed. No Pictologics module was imported into the GUI interpreter.
- All six real Slicer integration tests passed, including oblique anisotropic
  geometry, shared linear transforms, NIfTI staging, asynchronous worker PID
  observation, result validation, table commit, and cleanup.
- Slicer's CLI node returns integer percentage progress; the widget must not scale
  it by 100 again. The regression test checks 0, 1, 25, 50, 75, and 100. A single ROI
  retains an indeterminate indicator because upstream has no progress callback.
- The existing official/native IBSI identifiers, long package feature names,
  preprocessing metadata, and export contracts are preserved.
- 429 local tests passed, with 100% coverage of the Slicer-neutral library and CLI
  worker (not 100% GUI coverage); Ruff and strict scoped Mypy passed.
- The complete [GitHub qualification run](https://github.com/martonkolossvary/SlicerPictologics/actions/runs/35464267250)
  passed all five jobs: quality/coverage, released-wheel checks on Windows, macOS
  and Linux, and all six real Slicer integration tests on Linux. The download is
  pinned to Slicer 5.12.4 and verified against its official SHA512 checksum.

## Release adoption

The [adoption workflow](../.github/workflows/adopt-pictologics-release.yml) polls PyPI
every six hours, and also supports manual and repository-dispatch triggers.
Its live [0.5.1 discovery/no-op run](https://github.com/martonkolossvary/SlicerPictologics/actions/runs/35464119046)
passed. There is no newer stable release with which to demonstrate a real automatic
version-advancing publication yet.

Each candidate must pass the same [qualification workflow](../.github/workflows/compatibility.yml)
as ordinary CI: workflow lint, unit/coverage/type checks, private-wheel API/JIT and
numerical parity on Linux/Windows/Intel macOS, and actual Slicer on Linux. Publication
has its own write-enabled job, changes only the exact requirement, rechecks yank
status, and fails if the validated main-branch revision has been superseded.
No cross-repository PAT is needed. No repository protection settings were changed.

This updates the extension repository, not already installed source copies.
Development users pull the new extension code; catalog users will update the extension
through Slicer once catalog distribution is available. Then the module installs the
new adopted wheel. Startup never silently upgrades dependencies.

## Reassessment: next priorities

1. **Finish catalog distribution.** Finalize the catalog identifier (the existing
   Slicer prefix needs review as a library-bridge exception, or choose Pictologics),
   supply a catalog-compatible raster icon and an informative screenshot, add the
   `3d-slicer-extension` repository topic, and reconcile CMake/catalog metadata.
   Run the ExtensionsIndex validator and submit for Preview and the supported Stable
   branch. Verify Extension Factory packaging and installation/update through
   Extensions Manager. This is the missing link between automatic adoption and
   delivery to ordinary users.
2. **Broaden actual application acceptance.** Run Slicer Preview and real Windows
   Slicer (normal-Python Windows checks alone are insufficient), then record an
   interactive checklist: first install, restart, multiple ROIs, busy/progress,
   cancellation, append/export, and scene close during execution.
3. **Expose 0.5.1's new information in the UI.** The package now supplies versioned
   filter-capability metadata and requested/effective filtering parameters. Use it
   for a filter browser and clearer preprocessing/provenance inspection. It is not
   yet a complete configuration schema, so a fully generated multi-step editor still
   needs additional upstream API work.

The sibling Pictologics package is already at published 0.5.1. Its untracked
`notify-slicer-extension.yml` draft was left untouched: the independent schedule makes
that secret-dependent sender unnecessary. Existing Dependabot proposals for checkout,
setup-python, and Codecov are superseded by the adopted action majors; the
create-pull-request action is no longer used.
